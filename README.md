# UART-Data-Communication-with-Cyclic-Redundancy-Check
Data communication between PC and TI-TM4C123GH6PM ARM Cortex-M4 MCU using UART with Cyclic Redundancy Check. Data in a text file is sent to
the MCU and stored in EEPROM. The text file data is retrieved from the MCU and printed on the PC serial console. CRC8 is used to check corruption
of data. Data transmission speed is displayed when MCU sends data to PC.
